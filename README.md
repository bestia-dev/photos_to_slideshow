My projects on Github are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).

## Motivation

When I go on vacation I take thousands of photos from different devices.  
It is chaos.
I want to tame the chaos, but it is not easy.
The only thing that I really know about a photo is the moment it is taken.  
So I prefer to name the photos by date and time in this format `2025-12-31 23-59-59`.  
But I want to know which photos are mine and which photos are from my friends. So I append a prefix "LF" to make the difference.

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
